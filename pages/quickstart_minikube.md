This guide will help you deploying [KubeVirt](https://kubevirt.io) on
Kubernetes, we'll be using
[Minikube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/){:target="_blank"}.

Our recommendation is to always run the latest (*) version of
[Minikube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/){:target="_blank"}
available for your platform of choice, following their
[installation intructions](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/){:target="_blank"}. For instance, to write this guide, the **Linux** version has been used, together
with the [**KVM2**](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/blob/master/docs/drivers.md#kvm2-driver){:target="_blank"}
driver.

_(*): KubeVirt >=v0.9.2 won't run on Minikube <v0.35.0 by default because of lack of vhost-net device. (see more details at [Issue#2056](https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/issues/2056))_

Finally, you'll need *kubectl* installed, it can be downloaded from [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/#install-kubectl-binary-via-curl){:target="_blank"} or installed using the means available for your platform.

## Start Minikube

Before starting with Minikube, let's verify whether nested virtualization is enabled on the
host where Minikube is being installed on:

```bash
{% include scriptlets/quickstart_minikube/00_verify_nested_virt.sh -%}
```

If you get an **N**, follow the instructions described [here](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/using-nested-virtualization-in-kvm/index.html){:target="_blank"} for enabling it.


**Note** that nested virtualization is not mandatory for testing KubeVirt, but makes things smoother. If for any reason it can't be enabled, don't forget to enable emulation as shown in the *Check for the Virtualization Extensions* section.


Let's begin, normally, Minikube can be started with default values and those will be enough
to run this quickstart guide, that being said, if you can spare few more GiBs
of RAM (by default it uses 2GiB), it'll allow you to experiment further this guide.

We'll create a profile for KubeVirt so it gets its own settings without
interfering what any configuration you might had already, let's start by
increasing the default memory to 4GiB:

```bash
{% include scriptlets/quickstart_minikube/01_minikube_config_memory.sh -%}
```

Now, set the VM driver to KVM2:

```bash
{% include scriptlets/quickstart_minikube/02_minikube_config_vm_driver.sh -%}
```

We're ready to start the Minikube VM:

```bash
{% include scriptlets/quickstart_minikube/03_start_minikube.sh -%}
```

## Deploy KubeVirt Operator

Having the Minikube VM is up and running, let's set the *version* environment
variable that will be used on few commands:

```bash
{% include scriptlets/quickstart_minikube/04_setenv_version.sh -%}
```

Now, using the `kubectl` tool, let's deploy the KubeVirt Operator:

```bash
{% include scriptlets/quickstart_minikube/05_deploy_operator.sh -%}
```

Check it's running:

```bash
{% include scriptlets/quickstart_minikube/06_check_operator_running.sh -%}

NAME                             READY     STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
virt-operator-6c5db798d4-9qg56   0/1       ContainerCreating   0          12s
...
virt-operator-6c5db798d4-9qg56   1/1       Running   0         28s
```

We'll need to execute the command above few times (or add *-w* for *watching*
the pods), until the operator is *Running* and *Ready* (1/1), then it's time
to head to the next section.

## Check for the Virtualization Extensions

To check if your VM's CPU supports virtualization extensions execute the
following command:

```bash
{% include scriptlets/quickstart_minikube/07_verify_virtualization.sh -%}
```

If the command doesn't generate any output, create the following *ConfigMap*
so that KubeVirt uses emulation mode, otherwise skip to the next section:

```bash
{% include scriptlets/quickstart_minikube/08_emulate_vm_extensions.sh -%}
```

## Deploy KubeVirt

KubeVirt is then deployed by creating a dedicated custom resource:

```bash
{% include scriptlets/quickstart_minikube/09_deploy_kubevirt.sh -%}
```

Check the deployment:

```bash
{% include scriptlets/quickstart_minikube/06_check_operator_running.sh -%}

NAME                               READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
virt-api-649859444c-fmrb7          1/1       Running   0          2m12s
virt-api-649859444c-qrtb6          1/1       Running   0          2m12s
virt-controller-7f49b8f77c-kpfxw   1/1       Running   0          2m12s
virt-controller-7f49b8f77c-m2h7d   1/1       Running   0          2m12s
virt-handler-t4fgb                 1/1       Running   0          2m12s
virt-operator-6c5db798d4-9qg56     1/1       Running   0          6m41s
```

Once we applied the *Custom Resource* the operator took care of deploying the
actual KubeVirt pods (*virt-api*, *virt-controller* and *virt-handler*). Again
we'll need to execute the command until everything is *up&running*
(or use *-w*).

## Install virtctl

An additional binary is provided to get quick access to the serial and graphical ports of a VM, and handle start/stop operations.
The tool is called *virtctl* and can be retrieved from the release page of KubeVirt:

```bash
{% include scriptlets/quickstart_minikube/11_get_virtctl.sh -%}
```

## Deploy a VirtualMachine

Now that KubeVirt is ready, let's deploy our first VM:

```bash
{% include scriptlets/quickstart_minikube/12_create_vm.sh -%}
```

Using *kubectl* we can get the object and its YAML definition:

```bash
{% include scriptlets/quickstart_minikube/13_get_vms.sh -%}
{% include scriptlets/quickstart_minikube/14_get_vms_yaml.sh -%}
```

**Note** the field *running* is set to *false*, that means we've only defined
the object but it now needs to be instantiated. So let's start the VM:

```bash
{% include scriptlets/quickstart_minikube/15_virtctl_start_vm.sh -%}
```

Then again, using *kubectl*, let's query for the VM instance:

```bash
{% include scriptlets/quickstart_minikube/16_get_vmis.sh -%}
{% include scriptlets/quickstart_minikube/17_get_vmis_yaml.sh -%}
```

**Note** the added *i*, as it stands for *VirtualMachineInstance*. Now, pay
attention to the *phase* field, its value will be transitioning from one state
to the next, indicating VMI progress to finish being set to *Running*.

Using again *virtctl*, let's connect to the VMI consoles interfaces:

```bash
{% include scriptlets/quickstart_minikube/18_virtctl_serial_console.sh -%}
{% include scriptlets/quickstart_minikube/19_virtctl_vnc_console.sh -%}
```

Remember that for exiting from the *console* to hit *Ctrl+]* (Control plus
closing square bracket).

**Note**: VNC requires *remote-viewer* from the *virt-viewer* package
installed on the host.

## Clean Up:

Let's stop the VM instance:

```bash
{% include scriptlets/quickstart_minikube/20_virtctl_stop_vm.sh -%}
```

Delete the VM:

```bash
{% include scriptlets/quickstart_minikube/21_kubectl_delete_vm.sh -%}
```

Delete the VM:

```bash
{% include scriptlets/quickstart_minikube/22_minikube_delete.sh -%}
```

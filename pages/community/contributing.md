## Introduction

Let's start with the relationship between the two important components:

* **Kubernetes** is a container orchestration system, and is used to run containers on a cluster
* **KubeVirt** is an add-on which is installed on-top of Kubernetes, to be able to add basic virtualization functionality to Kubernetes.

Even though KubeVirt is an add-on to Kubernetes, both of them have things in common:

* Mostly written in golang
* Often related to distributed microservice architectures
* Declarative and Reactive (Operator pattern) approach

This short page shall help to get started with the projects and topics surrounding them.

## Contributing to KubeVirt

### Our workflow

Contributing to KubeVirt should be as simple as possible. Have a question? Want to discuss something? Want to contribute something? Just open an [Issue](https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/issues){:target="_blank"}, a [Pull Request](https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/pulls){:target="_blank"}, or send a mail to our [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/kubevirt-dev){:target="_blank"}.

If you spot a bug or want to change something pretty simple, just go ahead and open an Issue and/or a Pull Request, including your changes at [kubevirt/kubevirt](https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt){:target="_blank"}.

For bigger changes, please create a tracker Issue, describing what you want to do. Then either as the first commit in a Pull Request, or as an independent Pull Request, provide an **informal** design proposal of your intended changes. The location for such propoals is [/docs](https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/tree/master/docs){:target="_blank"} in the KubeVirt core repository. Make sure that all your Pull Requests link back to the relevant Issues.

### Getting started

To make yourself comfortable with the code, you might want to work on some Issues marked with one or more of the following labels
[beginner](https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abeginner){:target="_blank"}, [help
wanted](https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22){:target="_blank"} or [bug](https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/labels/bug){:target="_blank"}. Any help is highly appreciated.

### Testing

**Untested features do not exist**. To ensure that what we code really works, relevant flows should be covered via unit tests and functional tests. So when thinking about a contribution, also think about testability. All tests can be run local without the need of CI. Have a look at the Testing section in the [Developer Guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/quickstart_minikube).

### Getting your code reviewed/merged

Maintainers are here to help you enabling your use-case in a reasonable amount of time. The maintainers will try to review your code and give you productive feedback in a reasonable amount of time. However, if you are blocked on a review, or your Pull Request does not get the attention you think it deserves, reach out for us via Comments in your Issues, or ping us on IRC [#kubevirt @irc.freenode.net](https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.freenode.net/kubevirt){:target="_blank"}.

Maintainers are:
